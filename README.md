# ðŸŒŠ Water Quality Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

The central objective of our semesterly project is, in largely, being able to develop a model that is robustly able to generate predictions for water quality-related metrics throughout the Bay Area, and develop metrics that can support the resource allocation question:

- *Based on the predicted water quality features (pH, Magnesium, and DO levels), this project will help determine where to prioritize investments in infrastructure, such as water treatment plants, drainage systems, and nitrate removal technologies, across the Bay Area, as well as restoration efforts, with the end goal being to improve water quality management.*

We aim to tackle this question through our 3 different prediction questions:

1) ***Dissolved Oxygen Prediction: Train and evaluate different models to forecast dissolved oxygen levels in the Bay Areaâ€™s aquatic ecosystems (one day into the future), using values such as Water Temperature, Turbidity, pH, Nitrate, Month, and Year, and created Lagged Features to capture temporal effects..***
2) ***pH Prediction: Train and evaluate prediction models to predict pH levels within Bay Area counties (one day into the future), using historical water quality data and environmental features such as Acidity, (H+), Salinity, previous pH, Light attenuation coefficient, water temperature, and Specific conductance.***
3)  ***Magnesium Prediction: Magnesium Prediction: Train prediction models to predict Magnesium levels using other mineral values such as calcium and sodium.***
