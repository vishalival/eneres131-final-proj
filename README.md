# ğŸŒŠ Water Quality Data Analysis

## ğŸ“Œ Project Objectives
1. **Potability Water Quality**:  
   - ğŸ“ˆ **Goal**: Predict pH levels 1 day into the future using other features in the dataset.  
   - ğŸ›  **Methodology**:  
     - Regularization techniques (e.g., **LASSO**) to retain relevant features.  
     - Examination of variable collinearity to ensure robust predictions.  

2. **Agricultural Water Quality**:  
   - ğŸŒ¾ **Goal**: Predict Nitrate levels 1 day into the future using other dataset features.

3. **Microbial Safety Water Quality**:  
   - ğŸ¦  **Goal**: Predict Total Coliform levels 1 day into the future to assess microbial safety.
