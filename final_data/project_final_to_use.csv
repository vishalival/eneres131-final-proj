The data are from the Central Files Archive at the National Park Service Water Resources Division in Fort Collins, Colorado.  The spring appears to have been developed years ago by a French Drain System and has a series of pipes which deliver water by free fall into a circular holding well, where it is then piped to three redwood storage tanks.",,N,,,

OST_SHPD,"USEPA, Office of Water, Office of Science and Technology, Standards and Health Protection Division",USEPANLFTS,National Lake Fish Tissue Study,"This study is a national screening-level survey of chemical residues in fish tissue from lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States (lower 48 states), excluding the Laurentian Great Lakes and Great Salt Lake. It is unique among national assessments of fish contamination in lakes because the sampling sites were selected according to a statistical (random) design. Study results allow EPA to estimate the percentage of lakes and reservoirs in the United States with chemical concentrations in fish tissue that are above levels of potential concern for humans or for wildlife that eat fish. This study also includes the largest set of chemicals ever studied in fish. Whole fish and fillets were analyzed for 268 persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals, including mercury, arsenic, dioxins and furans, the full complement of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and a large number of pesticides and semivolatile organic compounds.","Probabilistic - A probability sampling method is any method of sampling that utilizes some form of random selection. In order to have a random selection method, you must set up some process or procedure that assures that the different units in your population have equal probabilities of being chosen.",Y,EPA,,

Assessment Program (EMAP) and its partners have collected estuarine and 
coastal data from hundreds of stations along the coasts of the continental United States. Types of data include 
water column parameters, sediment chemistry and toxicity, benthic communities, demersal fish, and tissue contaminants. 
EMAP's National Coastal Assessment comprises all the estuarine and coastal sampling done by EMAP between 1997 and 2006. 
This includes the sampling done in the biogeographic provinces as well as data from the Regional EMAP (REMAP) 
studies done by EPA Regional Offices. 
Data collected between 2000 and 2006 was collected by the ""Coastal 2000"" program using an integrated, comprehensive coastal 
monitoring program among the coastal states.","Probabilistic - A probability sampling method is any method of sampling that utilizes some form of random selection.

There are four objectives of the SFAN water quality monitoring program including the following:    Determine variability and long term trends in water quality through monthly summaries of select parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonia, flow, fecal and total coliforms), at selected sites in priority freshwater sites.     Determine the existing ranges and diurnal variability of water temperature, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen at selected sites in priority streams within SFAN.    Note: All data in this project are collected during routine site visits (regardless of 'Hydrologic event' code). Any data collected during targeted site visits (targeted storms, ""first flush"", etc) are entered into the SFAN_I&M_EXTRA project.    Determine the extent that priority streams within SFAN meet federal and state water quality criteria for fecal indicator bacteria, un-ionized ammonia, dissolved oxygen, and pH through monthly sampling.    Determine the annual, seasonal, and 30-day mean fecal coliform load to Tomales Bay (an impaired water body) from Olema Creek as required by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board's Tomales Bay Pathogen TMDL Program.",,N,,https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/providers/STORET/organizations/11NPSWRD_WQX/projects/SFAN_I%26M/files,

11NPSWRD_WQX,National Park Service Water Resources Division,JOMU0001,USGS National Uranium Resource Evaluation Data for JOMU,"Data originated from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) program which was initiated by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Department of Energy; DOE) in 1973 with a primary goal of identifying uranium resources in the United States. The Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance (HSSR) program was one of nine components of NURE. Planned systematic sampling of stream sediments, soils, groundwater, and surface water over the entire United States began in 1975 under the responsibility of four DOE national laboratories.  The data are the results of work performed by the Bendix Field Engineering Corporation, Operating Contractor for the DOE, as part of the NURE program, and by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Samples were collected from 320 quadrangles (1 degree X 2 degrees) beginning in 1976 and ending in 1980.  In 1985, the NURE HSSR sample archive, original field maps, field notes, and data tapes became the responsibility of the USGS.  NURE data files were released by the USGS on CD-ROM (Lower 48 States; Hoffman and Buttleman, 1994: Alaska; Hoffman and Buttleman, 1996).  The USGS began a new effort to recompile the NURE HSSR data in 1995. All of the original 894 files were examined, reformatted, and added to a USGS enhanced version of the NURE HSSR data. The data are contained in 2 major database files, one for water samples and one for sediment samples (which also includes soil and some rock samples.)  These data were accessed through the online USGS Open-File Report 97-492, 'National Geochemical Database, Reformatted Data from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance (HSSR) Program' Version 1.4 (2006) by Steven M. Smith.",,N,,,
